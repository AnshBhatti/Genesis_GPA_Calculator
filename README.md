Dependencies:
- Selenium
- Pandas

Instructions:
1) If you haven't yet, update your Google Chrome
2) If you haven't yet, install the dependencies stated above
3) Right-click on the python file, edit using IDLE, then click on whatever Python version you want to use
4) Run the program, everything you need is on the shell and you don't need to do anything else

Issues:
1) Chrome-only
2) For weighted gpa, class weights are determined by their names (whether they contain honor, ap, or ib), so for classes that are weighted but not named so it won't give the right weighted gpa (not an issue for the Academy)
3) Doesn't account for final exams yet
